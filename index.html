        <p>Hi! Thanks for visiting my site. I'm a Toronto-area web developer, with a background in broadcast media and written communications. After almost entering web development around 2000, I chose to go into TV/Radio production. I loved it, but found I was being drawn into administrative positions. I left the industry and tried my hand a few different things, including writing fiction for about 5 years. This is tough industry to earn a living from, but I loved writing.</p>
        <p>In the fall of 2015 I took a web development bootcamp at BrainStation, here in Toronto. I loved it. Since finishing that, I've been working as a freelance web developer, working mainly with a designer building custom themes in WordPress. From me, you'll get a well-rounded person, who is technically inclined and also creatively inspired.</p>
        <p>Here are a few of the projects I've worked on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://wearemovementmedia.com">Movement Media</a>: A PR agency in Washington D.C.</li>
          <li><a href="http://andalsotoo.net">And Also Too</a>: A Design Firm in Toronto</li>
          <li><a href="https://michaellsmith.github.io/recipeBox/">Recipe Box</a>: A personal project in React/Redux</li>

        </ul>
